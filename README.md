# About Me

> I’m the engineer teams call when things get complicated, confusing, or just a little chaotic (but no, I won’t fix your printer).

I’m a Senior Engineer with a business background and a career that zigzags across disciplines in the best possible way. That mix lets me talk API design and ROI in the same breath — then turn around and mentor junior engineers through their first big feature launch. I thrive in ambiguity, learn fast, and enjoy turning messy problems into software that actually ships.

## TL;DR — What peers and leaders say
Below are short excerpts from recommendations that reflect the kinds of impact I aim to bring.

### Owning problems end to end
> “He is my primary point of contact for solving major technical challenges… from initial research to delivering a code-complete solution.”

I’m comfortable carrying work from fuzzy problem statements to production-ready solutions.

### Strong analysis & decision-making
> “Extremely gifted at examining an issue, identifying its root cause, and determining a best path forward.”

I focus on understanding systems deeply and making pragmatic, durable decisions.

### Rapid learning & adaptability
> “Known organizationally as someone who can rapidly get up to speed on a brand new platform…”
>
> “An insatiable appetite for learning… take ownership of so many different technical systems…”

New platforms turn into ownership opportunities, not blockers.

### Code quality & product impact
> “His ability to spot issues in code, mitigate technical debt, and contribute to the overall Product is unmatched.”

I care about building software that lasts, not just software that works today.

### Clear communication & big-picture thinking
> “Ability to communicate comments and concerns in a candid but professional way.”
>
> “Is what we are building contributing to the overall vision of the Product and how?”

I surface risks early, keep customer impact front and center, and lead through influence rather than title.

### Team glue
> “A fantastic peer mentor and guide…”
>
> “He can make the team healthy if it is not.”
>
> “Very fun… making the work day fun.”

I take pride in helping teams work better — technically and culturally.

I build things, fix things, and occasionally perform quiet miracles in production. If your team needs someone who can ship, steward, mentor, and occasionally save the day, let’s connect. See [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asavas/) for full recommendations and context.
